## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Main Development Server
```bash
# Start Vite dev server (React app + static files)
npm run dev
# Access at: http://localhost:5173
```

### Testing Specific Tools

#### Route Optimizer
```bash
# Open route optimizer directly
npm run test:route
# Opens: http://localhost:5173/route-optimizer.html
```

#### Email Tool
```bash
# Open email tool directly  
npm run test:email
# Opens: http://localhost:5173/email-optimized.html
```

### Additional Server Options
```bash
# Vite server with network access (for testing on other devices)
npm run serve
# Shows local and network URLs

# Static file server (alternative, serves only public folder)
npm run serve:static
# Opens: http://localhost:3001
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🔧 Development Tips

### Testing HTML Tools
1. **With Vite (Recommended)**: Files in `public/` are served at the root
   - `public/route-optimizer.html` → `http://localhost:5173/route-optimizer.html`
   - Hot reload is NOT available for static HTML files

2. **Direct File Access**: Open HTML files directly in browser
   - Right-click file → Open with Browser
   - Good for quick testing, but some features may be limited

3. **Network Testing**: Use `npm run serve` to test on mobile/other devices
   - Check console output for network URL
   - Ensure devices are on same network

### Making Changes

#### To HTML Tools (route-optimizer.html, email-optimized.html):
- Edit files directly in `public/`
- Refresh browser to see changes
- No build step required

#### To React App:
- Edit files in `src/`
- Changes auto-reload with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Build before deploying

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
npx vite --port 3000
```

### Dependencies Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Open Developer Tools → Network → Disable cache
